= Fortran Debug Utilities

A collection of some utilities useful for debugging code.

WARNING: These procedures are not intended to be included in production code!
    Make sure you remove them once done with debugging

== Example
Use the `dbg` subroutine to write to stdout, even from pure and elemental procedures:

// include:: directives does not render on GitHub üôÅ
[source,fortran]
----
module example_mod
    implicit none

    private
    public some_pure_sub

contains

    pure subroutine some_pure_sub()

        block
            use debug_utils, only: dbg
            call dbg('Hello from some_pure_sub' // new_line('c')  &
                    // 'This can be useful for debugging pure procedures')
        end block
    end subroutine

end module

program example
    use example_mod, only: some_pure_sub
    implicit none

    write(*,'(a)') 'Before pure sub'
    call some_pure_sub
    write(*,'(a)') 'After pure sub'
end program
----

Note the use of a `block` which could be convenient to keep module use and the
subroutine call close to each other.
This outputs:

----
Before pure sub
[debug]
    Hello from some_pure_sub
    This can be useful for debugging pure procedures
After pure sub
----
